Welcome to Rooms!
This game has one simple objective: get out.
In this game, you're stuck in a house which contains 9 rooms, of which you have to navigate to eventually find the exit.
One of the bordered rooms will have an exit attached, which you can use to leave the house and complete the game.
There are two items placed in each room, making a total of 18 items, one of which is required to exit the house. It's up to you to find which one is needed to exit.
So, in short, in order to exit the house, you must aquire the correct object, and then proceed to find the exit attached to the outside of one of the bordering rooms.
You begin with a phone in your inventory, which you can trade for any of the items found in the rooms.
