==========IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS TO OPEN/COMPILE/RUN PROGRAM===========

 - In order to consolodate space & make my coding more efficient, 
   a "Makefile" file was created. This file created object files for 
   compiling all the headers, cpp files and the main game program. That
   way, all i needed to do to compile was type the command "make" and it
   would run all the desired commands at once.

 - The executible for this is './game'; after compiling everything using 
   the makefile, enter './game' to run the program
