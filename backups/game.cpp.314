/*
	* SUB_ALGORITHM OF MAIN FOR BUILDING ROOMS: build the rooms for the house  
	* Steps: 
		1. Initialize a room array and a door array
		2. Set the currentRoom and currentDoor equal to 0
		3. Enter a nested for loop:
		   - Iterate the outer for loop one time until the counter equals Y_ROOMS (a definition set at the beginning of the program):
		     - Iterate the inner for loop one time until the counter equals X_ROOMS (a definition set at the beginning of the program):
		       - Set the room's x coordinate to the inner loop's counter, and the y value to the outer loop's
		       - If the room's x location is less than the max num of x rooms - 1 (in other words, not an eastern edged room):
			 - Create a door with:
                           - An EW orientation
			   - It's west room equal to the current room
			   - It's east room equal to the current room's eastern room 
		         - Set the current room's east door equal to that door, and the next room's west door equal to that door
			 - Incriment the door counter
		       - Else (in other words, it IS an eastern edged room), set the east door equal to -1 (in other words, it doesn't exist)
		       - Also, if the current room's x value is equal to 0 (meaning it's a western edged room), set it's western room equal to -1
		       - If the room's y location is less than the max num of y rooms - 1 (in other words, not a northern edged room):
			 - Create a door with:
                           - An NS orientation
			   - It's south room equal to the current room
			   - It's north room equal to the current room's northern room 
		         - Set the current room's northern door equal to that door, and the northernmost room's south door equal to that door
			 - Incriment the door counter
		       - Else (in other words, it IS a northern edged room), set the north door equal to -1 (in other words, it doesn't exist)
		       - Also, if the current room's y value is equal to 0 (meaning it's a southern edged room), set it's southern room equal to -1
		       - Incriment the room counter
		       - Finally, if the room equals a specific room (parameters varying), set the northern most door equal to -2 (meaning it's the exit room) */
